## "Eat Da Burger" Handlebars assignment

For this assignment, I had to use handlebars as a framework to dynamically create a burger website. On the burger website, you can add burgers to the database, then click "Devour it!" to add it to the list of devoured burgers. This also involved creating a mySQL database.

My biggest challenge wasn't even the assignment; it was getting it to deploy to Heroku. However, with the help of ASKBCS, I was able to get the issue resolved.

This assignment most certainly motivated me to continue my knowledge of mySQL and node js.
